# ACTIVISTAS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the 4 main requirements for the Activistas system.

## 1. Profile Display Fix âœ… COMPLETED

### Problem
Clicking on usernames in the ranking always showed the SuperAdmin profile instead of the selected user's profile.

### Solution
- **Modified:** `controllers/userController.php`
  - Added `user_id` parameter handling in `profile()` method
  - Added authorization checks (Activista can only view own profile)
  - Support for viewing other users' profiles for authorized roles

- **Modified:** `views/profile.php`  
  - Added conditional display for own profile (editable) vs others (read-only)
  - Enhanced UI to show social media links for viewed profiles
  - Added navigation back to own profile

### Result
- âœ… Profile links in ranking now work correctly
- âœ… Proper authorization implemented
- âœ… Enhanced user experience with read-only profile views

## 2. Compliance Traffic Light System âœ… COMPLETED

### Problem
Need to add compliance level indicators in User Management with traffic light colors based on task completion percentage.

### Solution
- **Modified:** `models/user.php`
  - Added `getUserCompliancePercentage($userId)` method
  - Added `getAllUsersWithCompliance($filters)` method with compliance calculation
  - SQL queries calculate completion percentage: `(completed_tasks / total_tasks) * 100`

- **Modified:** `controllers/userController.php`
  - Updated `listUsers()` to use compliance data
  - Added compliance filter support

- **Modified:** `views/admin/users.php`
  - Added compliance filter dropdown
  - Added compliance column with color-coded indicators:
    - ğŸŸ¢ **Green** (>60%): High compliance
    - ğŸŸ¡ **Yellow** (20-60%): Medium compliance  
    - ğŸ”´ **Red** (<20%): Low compliance
    - âš« **Gray** (0%): No tasks assigned

### Result
- âœ… Visual compliance indicators implemented
- âœ… Filterable by compliance level
- âœ… Real-time calculation from database

## 3. Activity Proposal System âœ… COMPLETED

### Problem
Allow activists to propose activities that can be authorized by SuperAdmin/Gestor/LÃ­der with 100-point ranking bonus.

### Solution
- **Modified:** `models/activity.php`
  - Added `createProposal($data)` method
  - Added `getPendingProposals($filters)` method  
  - Added `approveProposal($activityId, $approved, $approverId)` method
  - Added `addProposalBonus($userId)` method (100 points)
  - Uses `tarea_pendiente = 2` to distinguish proposals

- **Modified:** `controllers/activityController.php`
  - Added `showProposalForm()` method
  - Added `createProposal()` method
  - Added `listProposals()` method
  - Added `processProposal()` method

- **Created:** New views and routes
  - `views/activities/propose.php` - Proposal form for activists
  - `views/activities/proposals.php` - Management interface for admins
  - `public/activities/propose.php` - Route for proposal form
  - `public/activities/create_proposal.php` - Route for creating proposals
  - `public/activities/proposals.php` - Route for listing proposals
  - `public/activities/process_proposal.php` - Route for processing proposals

### Result
- âœ… Activists can propose activities through dedicated form
- âœ… Approval workflow for SuperAdmin/Gestor/LÃ­der implemented
- âœ… 100-point bonus system working
- âœ… Complete UI for proposal management

## 4. Export Functionality âœ… COMPLETED

### Problem
Enable Excel export for User Management and My Activities with compliance data.

### Solution
- **Created:** `public/admin/export_users.php`
  - CSV export (Excel-compatible) functionality
  - Includes all user data plus compliance information
  - Respects current filters (rol, estado, cumplimiento)
  - UTF-8 BOM for proper Excel character encoding

- **Modified:** `views/admin/users.php`
  - Made export button functional
  - Passes current filters to export script

### Export Includes
- Basic user information (ID, name, email, phone, role, status)
- Compliance data (total tasks, completed tasks, percentage, traffic light classification)
- Ranking points and registration date
- Leader assignment information

### Result
- âœ… Functional Excel export with compliance data
- âœ… Filters are preserved in export
- âœ… Proper UTF-8 encoding for Spanish characters

## Database Schema Usage

The implementation leverages existing database schema effectively:

- **`usuarios.ranking_puntos`** - For storing ranking points including proposal bonuses
- **`actividades.tarea_pendiente`** - Values:
  - `0` = Normal activity
  - `1` = Assigned task  
  - `2` = Proposal (new usage)
- **`actividades.solicitante_id`** - Tracks who created/proposed the activity
- **`actividades.estado`** - Activity status (programada, completada, cancelada)

## Testing

Created `test_improvements.php` script that validates:
- âœ… Model instantiation and method availability
- âœ… Database schema requirements
- âœ… Error handling in database-free environment
- âœ… PHP syntax validation for all files
